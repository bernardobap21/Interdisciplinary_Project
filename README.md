# Interdisciplinary_Project
Repository for Interdisciplinary Project in Data Science (Remote Sensing) at TU Wien

This repository contains the Python code for analyzing the spatio-temporal dynamics of the reed belt in Lake Neusiedl 
using Sentinel-1 radar data. The methodology, including data preprocessing, CR calculation, clustering, and visualization, 
is fully implemented and well-commented for ease of understanding and reproducibility.

The folder with the Shapefiles is included in the repository, but the original Sentinel-1 radar data is not due to their large size. 
To run the code, you will need to download the required data and update the file paths accordingly. Detailed comments are 
provided within the code to guide you through the workflow.

For questions or further assistance, please feel free to reach out via e12143531@student.tuwien.ac.at.
